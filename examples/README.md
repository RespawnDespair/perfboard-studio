# Examples

Six finished circuits, each shipped twice: as the `.net` a schematic tool exports, and as
the `.perf` that importing, placing and routing it produces. And one **project** —
[`ne555-blinker/`](./ne555-blinker/) — which is the other end of the same workflow: a
circuit that has been drawn and not yet built. Start there if what you want to see is how
the tool goes from a schematic to a board.

```sh
perfboard-studio examples/lm317-supply.perf     # open the finished board
```

...or start from the netlist the way you would with your own circuit: **File → Import
KiCad Netlist**, then follow the step bar -- **Choose a Board**, **Place on the Board**
(`Ctrl+Shift+A` arranges it again from another seed), `Ctrl+R` to route,
`Ctrl+B` for the build guide.

Every board below is one a supplier stocks, in the exact size on the packet, with the
finger strips down two edges and the screw hole in each corner it is sold with — and it is
the size this application's own **Choose a Board** recommends for that circuit, placed the
way **Place on the Board** then places it: the build script asks the same question the
window does, and the answer is tried rather than estimated — the circuit is placed, routed
and checked on a roomy board and on each size below it, and the smallest that builds as well
wins. They used to be on grids nobody sells (32 × 22, 30 × 20), and after that on sizes
written into the script by hand — atmega328-relay's said 9 × 15 cm, and it builds just as
cleanly on 7 × 9.

| | parts | board | what it is there to show |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ne555-astable** | 8 | **2 × 8 cm**, 5 × 30, FR-4 | The starting point. A 555 flashing an LED — the circuit everybody has built. |
| **lm317-supply** | 11 | **4 × 6 cm**, 14 × 20, FR-4 | A hot part. The regulator is a TO-220, so the heat-proximity rule has something to measure. |
| **lpb1-booster** | 12 | **5 × 7 cm**, 18 × 26, **FR-2** | The material mattering. Phenolic is what a pedal actually gets built on and it is the board whose pads lift, so the guide drops the iron 30 °C (350 → 320) and cuts the dwell from 3 s to 2 s. |
| **arduino-io-shield** | 11 | **2 × 8 cm**, 5 × 30, FR-4 | Headers. Two of them, 8-pin and 6-pin, which is what a shield mostly is — and the case where lead bends and short traces do nearly all the work. |
| **atmega328-relay** | 24 | **7 × 9 cm**, 27 × 35, FR-4 | Scale, and what it costs. An ATmega328 with a 7805, a crystal, a relay and four connectors: 24 nets, 60 conductors, an 84-step guide with 102 checkpoints and 53 wires to cut. It is also every rule at once — a TO-220 and a relay both run hot, two electrolytics mind, and the board's finger strips and corner screws take 50 holes nothing can be soldered into. |
| **nano-relay** | 14 | **6 × 8 cm**, 22 × 30, FR-4 | Real parts, out of a KiCad netlist as it stands. An Arduino Nano switching a 12 V relay through a BC547, fed by a 7805, with a push button and an LED. Nothing is named for it here: the Nano, the BC547, the 1N4007 and the 7805 come out of the catalog by their values, with their pin names; everything else by its KiCad footprint; and the Nano's pins, which KiCad numbers down one side and up the other, and the LED's, which it numbers cathode first, are renumbered by name. The terminals carry their pin names and the board two labels. |
| **ne555-blinker/** | 10 | *none yet* | The workflow, rather than its result. Ten parts in the design and nothing on the board, so **Choose a Board** has a board to find and **Place on the Board** an arrangement to make. Its own [README](./ne555-blinker/README.md) walks through it. |

All six route to completion, match their schematics under LVS, and carry no DRC error.
`tests/test_examples.py` asserts exactly that on every commit, so an example cannot rot
quietly — and for the project it asserts the walkthrough its README promises instead:
that the design is still a design, that the board question still lands on a stock board,
and that placing what it tried there, routing and checking still comes out clean.

## Regenerating them

```sh
python tools/build_examples.py            # rebuild every .perf from its .net
python tools/build_examples.py --check     # verify only, write nothing
```

The board each one goes on is the answer to the Board step's question
(`boardfit.choose_board`), which the script prints board by board as it is tried, and the
whole product is applied — the finger strips down two edges and the screw hole in each
corner. A finger is solid copper with no bore, which is why
`geometry.unusable_holes` exists and why the placer and the router had to be taught about
it before these examples could carry a real board.

They are routed the way **Ctrl+R** routes in the window — wires laid along the grid — and
not with the engine's own default, which lays each wire as one straight run because that is
what every golden route records. They were once routed with the engine's default, and the
first boards a stranger opened were a cat's cradle of diagonal wire the application itself
no longer produced.

The footprints are named in that script for five of them rather than read from the netlist
-- they were built before the importer could read one, and they are what they are. A netlist
knows a part is called `U1` and that three of its pins appear in nets, which is all
`guess_footprint_id` has to go on — enough for the app to land parts somewhere obvious
for you to correct, not enough for an example. An LM317 guesses to a DIP-8, and a TO-220
standing in for an 8-pin DIP would put the heat rule and the 3D height check both wrong.

The timestamps in the `.perf` files are fixed rather than current, so rebuilding an
example does not put a date change in the way of whatever the commit was about.

`nano-relay` is the one that names nothing. It reads each part exactly as
**File → Import KiCad Netlist** does -- `parsers.kicad_parts`, the catalog, the KiCad
footprint, the renumbering -- and puts them in the design, as the window does, so it is
also the end-to-end check of that reading. Its
terminals' pin names and its two labels are the only things the script adds, because a
KiCad screw terminal calls its pins `Pin_1` and `Pin_2`.

None of them names a seed. They used to, picked from a sweep as the cheapest of several
anneals — which made them a little better than what a user pressing the same buttons would
get. Every one is now placed exactly as the window places it after the Board step: the
placement the board was judged by, at seed 0.

## Adding one

Write the `.net`, add an entry to `CATALOGUE` in `tools/build_examples.py` naming the
board family -- and each part's footprint, or none at all to import it the way a user would --
and run the script. The size is not yours to name: it is what the board question answers. It fails loudly if the
circuit does not route cleanly, which is the point.
