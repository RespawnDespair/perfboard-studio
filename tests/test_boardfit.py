"""Which board a design goes on, answered by building it -- ``boardfit``.

Three layers, and only the last one routes anything:

1. The JUDGE, on synthetic trials: what makes a smaller board as good as the roomy one.
2. The SEARCH, with ``try_board`` replaced by a script: which boards are tried, in what
   order, and when it stops -- including when it is told to.
3. Two small REAL trials: that a trial is deterministic, and that the placement it judged
   is the placement the window commits.

The measurements the constants rest on are ``tools/measure_board_choice.py``'s; the
examples moving onto the boards this recommends is ``tests/test_examples.py``'s business.
