"""The README is written twice, in English and in Turkish, and the two must not drift.

A translation cannot be checked for meaning, but it can be checked for SHAPE, and drift has
a shape: a section added to one language and not the other is a heading, a table row, a code
block and a handful of identifiers that exist on one side only. So the two are held to the
same headings at the same levels, the same number of code blocks and table rows, and the
same inline code spans -- every `autoroute`, `version.py` and `.perf` -- counted, because a
command, a file name or a flag is spelled the same in every language and is exactly what a
paragraph nobody translated is made of.

Prose is free. A Turkish sentence may be ordered however Turkish grammar needs, split or
joined; what it may not do is lose, gain or rename the thing it is about.

It found two things on its first run. The Turkish README still called the whole project
Apache-2.0: the licence section had grown a paragraph about the CC-BY-SA meshes in 0.12.0,
in English only. And its "İki yüz" jump link pointed at an anchor no heading had.

Only the README is in two languages. ``docs/`` is English on purpose -- its readers are
developers and agents, and three pages kept in two languages cost more than they give -- so
there is nothing there to compare, and only its in-page links are checked.
