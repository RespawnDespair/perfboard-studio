"""Which stock board a design should go on -- TRIED, not estimated.

``placer.suggest_boards`` lays a design out on every stock board with the constructive
:func:`placer.arrange` and ``placer.recommended_board`` takes the first one it fills to a
third or less. That is quick, and it was calibrated on the examples' own recommended boards,
which is to say on itself -- and it was a board and a half too big. The 24-part
``atmega328-relay`` was sent to 9 x 15 cm while it places, routes and checks just as cleanly
on 7 x 9 cm, less than half the board: most of the substrate somebody paid for was bare.

So the recommendation is now answered by BUILDING the design on the boards, the way the
window would: put the whole design on a board (``placer.place_design``), route it, run DRC,
and compare the result with the same design on the roomy board. The cheap answer survives as
the REFERENCE -- the board the circuit certainly has room on -- and the search walks down
from it, one stock size at a time, for as long as the smaller board builds as well:

- every part placed, every connection routed, no DRC error;
- no placement warning the roomy board does not have (``PLACEMENT_WARNING_RULES`` --
  a hot part beside one that minds, a part under a screw head, a body over the edge, a
  terminal's wire entry blocked or facing into the board);
- no more than ``ROUTE_COST_TOLERANCE`` times the reference's routing cost.

It stops at the first board that fails, and recommends the smallest one that passed.

Pure, like every engine module: no clock, no Qt, and nothing random that is not seeded, so
the same design gets the same answer every time. The time a trial takes is the host's
business -- the window runs this on a worker thread with a Cancel button, and a trial that
was stopped part way is thrown away rather than judged.

#: How much dearer to route a smaller board may be than the reference and still count as
#: building as well -- the "balanced" setting, chosen over 1.05 and over no limit at all.
#:
#: What ``tools/measure_board_choice.py --seeds 0 1 2 3`` found, every example taken back to
#: its design and tried from the reference down: every smaller board that built with no new
#: warning cost between 0.80 and 1.17 times its reference, and every one rejected on cost
#: alone came out at 1.22 or more --
#:
#:     accepted, highest    nano-relay 7 x 9 1.17 · atmega328-relay 6 x 8 1.16 · 1.15, 1.14
#:     dearer, lowest       ne555-blinker 2 x 8 1.22 · lm317-supply 3 x 7 1.23 · nano 6 x 8 1.27
#:
#: -- so 1.20 falls in the gap between them rather than on either side of one. The ratio is a
#: proxy: routed solder-first, the atmega on 6 x 8 cm needed 57 wires where 9 x 15 needed 26,
#: and that is the kind of board it is there to catch.
ROUTE_COST_TOLERANCE = 1.20

#: How each board is placed for its trial: exactly as Auto-place and Place on the Board
#: place, the placer's own defaults at seed 0.
#:
#: Lighter was tried and is not worth the time it saves. A verdict compares ONE placement on
#: the smaller board with ONE on the reference, and an anneal's routed cost varies from seed
#: to seed -- nano-relay's reference came out between 353 and 402 -- so a lucky reference
#: rejects a board that builds perfectly well. Over seeds 0-3, two restarts with two routed
#: recommended four different boards for nano-relay and two each for ne555-astable and
#: lm317-supply; four restarts with two routed still left nano-relay on 9 x 15 cm at seed 0.
#: The defaults gave ne555-astable one answer on every seed and the other two one answer on
#: three of four, at about twice the time of the lightest.
#:
#: What the defaults recommend at seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, and the whole question's time at seed 0:
#:
#:     arduino-io-shield   5 x 7 ->  2 x 8   2 x 8   2 x 8   2 x 8      5 s
#:     atmega328-relay     9 x 15 -> 7 x 9   7 x 9   6 x 8   6 x 8     25 s
