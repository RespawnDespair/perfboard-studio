"""What the engine says about what it did, in the window's language.

A COMMAND DESCRIBES ITSELF IN ENGLISH, and has to. ``describe`` is the undo-stack label, the
line a replayed journal prints, the text an agent reads back from the MCP server -- and the
engine has no language of its own (CLAUDE.md, "i18n"). So in a Turkish window the status bar
said "Add J1 PWR to the schematic" and the Edit menu offered "Geri Al Place and arrange 8
part(s) from the schematic": every other word on the screen Turkish, and the one sentence
saying what just happened not.

The sentence is translated where it is SHOWN, which is the guide's arrangement turned round:
the guide builds its sentences from facts and so translates as it builds; a description is
already built, so it is recognised. ``TEMPLATES`` is every sentence the commands, the
planners and this window's own labels produce, as an English template whose fields are the
parts that vary; the catalogue in ``i18n`` holds each template's Turkish with the same
fields. ``say`` finds the template a sentence was made from and fills the Turkish one in.

Three things keep it honest:

- **A field says what it may contain** (``_FIELDS``): a count is digits, a hole is an
  address, a conductor kind is one of the six. Without that "Add R1 10k to the schematic"
  would be read as a conductor called R1 laid from 10k to "the schematic".
- **The more specific template comes first.** "Delete R1 and its 3 connection(s)" is also
  "Delete {ref}" with a very long reference; order is what separates them.
- **A planner's summary is clauses joined by ", "**, and one that matches no template
  whole is translated clause by clause. Anything still unrecognised is shown as it came:
  a half-English line is a worse sentence than a whole one, but it is never a wrong one.

``test_i18n`` holds the catalogue to these templates in both directions, and
``test_engine_text`` runs a session of real commands and fails on any description that
comes out untranslated -- which is what a new ``describe`` without a template looks like.
