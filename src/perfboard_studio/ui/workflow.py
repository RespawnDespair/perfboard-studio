"""The six steps a board is built in, where this document stands on each, and the next one.

THE WINDOW HAD EVERY TOOL AND NO ORDER. Thirty-three buttons across two toolbars, a board and
a sheet stacked on each other, and nothing anywhere saying what comes after what: that the
circuit is drawn first, that a board is chosen before the parts go on it, that routing is
what joins them, that DRC is what says the result can be built, and that the guide and the
3D view are what it is built from. Every one of those steps existed. None of them was
findable from the one before it -- the answer to "what do I do now?" lived in a paragraph of
text over an empty board, and it stopped being shown the moment the board had a part on it.

So this is the order, measured off the document every time it changes, and one button that
does whichever step is next. It decides nothing about the document -- every step's action is
an existing command reached from where it already was -- which is why it can be pure: the
facts go in, the steps come out, and a test can hand it facts.

Six steps and not five, because choosing the board is a decision of its own. A perfboard is
bought before it is populated, and the moment between drawing the circuit and placing it is
the last one at which the size is still free (``placer.suggest_boards``).
