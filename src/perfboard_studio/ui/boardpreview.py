"""A board as a picture: for the dialogs that choose one, before it is the board on screen.

THE BOARD WAS CHOSEN FROM WORDS. "5 x 7 cm · 18 × 24" in a combo box, and "fits, 29 %
full" in a list, while the thing being chosen is a physical object with finger strips down
two edges, a screw hole in each corner and a printed legend -- and, in the size question,
with the circuit laid out on it, which is the one fact that separates the size to buy from
the one that merely fits. Both dialogs now show it.

DRAWN BY THE BOARD VIEW ITSELF, not by a second painter. ``BoardScene`` is what the editor
shows and what the 1:1 print and the headless PNG render, so a preview built from it cannot
disagree with the board the user gets after pressing OK -- the fingers are where the view
will put them because it is the view putting them there.
